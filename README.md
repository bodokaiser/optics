# Optics

In particular this reporsitor provides a numerical implementation of

1. [Y. Li and F.T.S. Yu, Intensity distribution near the focus of an apertured focused Gaussian beam][1]
2. [H. Urey, Spot size, depth-of-focus, and diffraction ring intensity formulas for truncated Gaussian beams][2]

as well as a coarse approximation using the ray matrix method. The results can
be used to estimate the aperture limited focus resolution.
