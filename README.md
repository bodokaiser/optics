# Optics

This repository contains implementations of common optics methods, for
instance, Gaussian beams and geometrical transfer matrices.

Furtheremore it provides a numerical implementation of

1. [Y. Li and F.T.S. Yu, Intensity distribution near the focus of an apertured focused Gaussian beam][1]
2. [H. Urey, Spot size, depth-of-focus, and diffraction ring intensity formulas for truncated Gaussian beams][2]

that can be used to estimate the aperture limited focus resolution. This
project is not meant to be a standalone library!

## Usage

Install requirements, e.g. using `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
